# psc-sampler

This repository is (currently) just a place-holder for code implementing ideas included in an upcoming paper about direct light source sampling 

# Prerequisites

The code for light-source sampling (files PSCMap.h and PSCMap_impl.h) has no prerequisites, as it can be compiled as is. However file 'MapViewer.cpp'  (which implements a tool which visualizes the maps) The only pre-requisite is the anttweakbar library, which can be obtained here: [http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/doc/](http://anttweakbar.sourceforge.net/doc/)
